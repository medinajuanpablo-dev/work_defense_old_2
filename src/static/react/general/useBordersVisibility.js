/** How to calculate visibility of the page's Bottom.
 *
 * window.scrollY provides the amount of pixels scrolled from the top of the entire page.
 * In other words, it tells the exact pixel in which the very top of the screen is at the moment.
 *
 * Adding the window.innerHeight to the previous amount gives us the exact pixel of the bottom
 * of the screen. Let's call this value bottom_current_pixel.
 *
 * document.body.offsetHeight provides the amount of pixels of the entire document's body (the entire page).
 * Let's call it page_height.
 *
 * We may define an arbitrary range of pixels from the bottom that we consider "the bottom". If the user scrolls
 * any further than that, then "the bottom is visible". Let's call it bottom_range.
 *
 * Lastly, the question would be: Is the bottom_current_pixel higher than the page_height - bottom_range?
 *
 * This question in code would be:
 * bottomVisible = window.scrollY + window.screen.height > document.body.offsetHeight - PIXELS_FOR_VISIBLE_BOTTOM
 *
